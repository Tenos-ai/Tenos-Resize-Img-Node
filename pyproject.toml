name = "Tenos_Resize_to_1M_Pixels"
description = "A zero nonsense ComfyUI node that resizes every incoming image (or batch) so the final resolution hovers around one million pixelsâ€”while respecting the original aspect ratio and snapping both dimensions to multiples of 64. Perfect for pipelines that need a predictable VRAM footprint without destroying composition."
